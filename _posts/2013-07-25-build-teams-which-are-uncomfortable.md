I am product guy. I do believe that a business stays and falls with the product and its quality. With this background I am most fond of engineering and product teams. We speak the same language and get along great. But having gone through a few of those startup teams, getting along great, speaking the same language is not what makes them successful. It is actually quite the opposite: it is the diversity that makes you a great team.

What I mean by that is that in order to build a successful business it is not enough to just code something away with your buddies. **The Investor, who comes to take over all other things and just wants you to focus on building a great product, is a myth** (at least for us in Europe), it simply doesn't exist. So when investors say, they are looking for a great team, they clearly don't mean that kind of team. And it wasn't until I saw a super basics business talk (unfortunately I can't find it any more) before I realised what we did wrong. In the talk it said: **To build a business you need three people; someone building it, someone selling it and someone to collects the money.** Or as we would see it today: product, marketing and accounting/operation.

But what the talk focusses on is that you need all of those. If you have a product but no one selling it, no one will buy it. An experience I had and so did many other techies out there, I bet. I had my fair share of product-driven (not to say "product-only") teams and though it was a great experience and we accomplished a lot, we also failed. As a team we were getting along great, but we were missing basic things, just because we couldn't find anyone, who was on the same wave as we were but for marketing. So we ended up being without someone to sell the great products we built and while Silicon Valley tells us this is fine, it actually isn't.

I believe that this might simply doesn't exist; someone from a product side but for marketing. There is a very different cultures and believe systems behind marketing and product people. And to some degree those collide and will continue to do so. I don't think I'll ever find a marketing guy, who wants to sell the products I am building and agrees on all parts of how I build them. I call that person a product guy. But my next team will definitely have some more people with a marketing background, because without marketing there is not selling any product. In internet business there is no store that people just walk in and see what you have to offer. Without marketing people won't know you even exist and will never find you.

As a team, we will struggle and fight because we don't speak the same language and don't always agree on the goals and values. And yes, there will be compromises on the product to make it easier to sell. My next team will not just be put together because those are fun people to work with, I chose to work with people where that is not the case. My next team will be uncomfortable, on choice.

BTW. I am still looking for smart online-marketing people to partner up with. I indeed do have some products I need help selling, so, if you are interested, let me know.

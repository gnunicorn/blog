The single most remarkable thing when looking at companies or foundations started and run by techies and engineers compared to those funded by purely business types is the reasoning behind them. As developers and engineers are paid more than well and enjoy freedoms unlike any other profession, financial or social gain barely plays any role in it for them. And it it was the choice to go freelancing or do consultancy work was never far away. And while for business people entrepreneurship and "starting your own thing" are a means by itself, basically the highest promotion you can get in this type of career, it never meant much to techies. No, techies start their own thing for a reason. It has a purpose. They want to fix something, that is broken. And that's what makes those so powerful. I'd even argue, if you startup doesn't have a purpose, you are bound to fail (eventually).


Simon Sinek said it very well: ["People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it."](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action). This applies to startups as to any other thing in life. When we talk about "buy" in this context, we don't only mean the product you are building or the service you are offering – we are talking about all human interaction and communication. It goes through the entire structure of your venture. Not only when you want to hire a new rock star or try to [build diverse teams](/2013/07/31/diversity-is-crucial-for-startup-culture/). But from what keeps your core team together even after big disputes and fights – it is a common purpose, the reason _why_ you are doing it. That reason is also why your community sticks with you and keeps contributing even though the other competition has more shiny buttons. In fact, you need an actual to have ["the <stroke>passion</stroke>pain" investors ask you for](/2012/07/13/when-they-say-passion-they-mean-pain/) and is the main ingredient for your "startup story".

Sure, occasionally, we have the big funded nothingness-startup getting lost of money out of hype without any purpose whatsoever – and a bunch of similar-doing startup around them. But when have you last been on [Second Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life)? I rest my case. It's very said but the big numbers often overshadow the real successes and projects with actual impact – like [Minecraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft) in [this case](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/beyond-screen-time-what-a-good-game-like-minecraft-teaches-kids/361261/). And very few methods to allow us to see behind them easily and startup journalism plays its role in making it even harder.

But if you want to make an actual dent in the universe. If you want to build a [for-good](/2013/11/14/recoining-non-for-profit-to-for-good/) having an impact, than you need to focus on the purpose first. As Sinek said it: ["People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it."](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action). And there is nothing wrong with being upfront about the reasoning why you are doing what you are doing. It will help you tremendously in finding partners, who share the same values. It will allow you to build a community and make the impact this world to desperately needs.Instead of wasting your time, make sure to use tools that help you build your venture in a purpose-first approach – like the [Tech Creationist Canvas](/2014/08/19/introducing-the-tech-creationist-canvas/).

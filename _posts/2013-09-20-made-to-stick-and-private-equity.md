### Made To Stick

Chip and Dan Heath put together a compendium of their lives work: the quest of understanding why some ideas and concepts stick with people while others don't. And they've found certain aspect in the way they are communicated and spoken about, which makes them more likely to be successful. This books contains those separated into groups, sorted and analysed case by case. And though case studies can be kinda dull, it is written very vividly and invites you to rethink your past and current communication

And as it is written right to the point, it also give helpful hints on how to improve and make things clearer and better by applying certain concepts, ideas and principles. But even if you don't have a certain case at hand you are interested to be solving right now, years later - for me most recently when launching [Hackership](http://www.hackership) - it will help you find your voice, terms, brands and identify problems in your communication down the line.

### Private Equity 

{.right} ![Cover of "Private Equity by Oliver Thum"](http://ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=3800631695&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=DE&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=cbe-21)
Unfortunately Private Equity works a little different in Germany and Europe than it does in the US. Not only in terms of finding funding but also on the actual papers: a GmbH simply isn't a Ltd. They are structured different and there are different things to know and take into account when dealing with equity with them. And sure, you can just hire someone to do that part for you or simply trust the investor you are talking to (DON'T! EVER!), that everything is going to be alright. But the smarter and better thing to do is to get familiar with that topic before hand.

This rather thin book by Oliver Thum provides a great head first entry into that level and unlike many other books in this field talks about the most recent ways of company structuring. It will help you understand the way funding works on papers, what those things like liquidation preference and others actually mean and gives useful tips on things to look out for by referring to what is common practice and what is for the disadvantage of some party. As this books talks about the German legal system and forms it is only available in German.

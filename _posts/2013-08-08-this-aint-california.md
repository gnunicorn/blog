One of the reasons I am writing this blog in english is because of the audience I want to reach. Yes, I also do it because I find it much easier but more importantly I want to reach those, who are reading all those blogs from the silicon valley, from these incubators, the failures and winners and the investors. And I want to reach those readers because, what they have been told, so many advices, which haven been and still are given, simply don't work here. But every now and then I still meet people, who almost blindly follow the advice and I just want to tell them: look, that sounds great and might worked there but *this ain't California*.

I mentioned it already in a side-sentence the other day, the story of the purely technical team that gets millions from some investor and get big over night, is a myth. It already is in the U.S. but even more so over here in Europe, where this literally doesn't happen. And the reasons for that are as versatile as it is simple: this ain't California. Even the same Funds from the U.S., which tell to only focus on your product in their blog, don't fund those teams here. The main reason being their unfamiliarity with the local market lead to create and run a local team managing a much smaller amount of money. And those people are rarely partners, nor bold enough to actually push something risky. Those european offices mostly run by numbers. So if you don't have any sales, it gets really hard to get funded. This ain't California.

The same goes for the pre-early-stage phase, where the U.S. has plenty of former entrepreneurs, who invest in stuff just because they love the idea and then push it through their investors to other rounds. And yes, these people are telling you to focus on the product only, because with everything else they are easy find them for you once the product is done, so you have to worry about that much less. But these people are not the majority of Business Angels in Germany. Money here comes from Farmacists, Doctors, Lawyers, Business Owners, Banks and Family offices - who rarely understand what you are talking about let alone come with a network to help you sell stuff. If you don't come up with the network and sell your stuff, no one will. This ain't California.

But once you got your head up and start selling stuff, you will pretty quickly realise another important difference between Berlin in Europe and California in the U.S. the market. And I know I am repeating myself here. But rolling out something like Twitter is just ten times easier if you have a market size of 300 million, speaking the same language than it is with 80 million. And it is ten times easier to get money from someone to aid that roll out, it goes much smoother not to say, you'll have global adaption even before you officially launch it in many countries. Good luck trying the same with a Product from Germany or Sweden. But even Spain or France, if you really want to tap the big markt speaking that language you have to cross huge oceans. You are not embedded in a bigger easily accessible market. This is not California.

Don't worry, I won't make a big review or anything here. But I've read my fair share of books over the years and there is a few that I always get back or refer back to when getting asked where I get things from. So I decided to kick off a mini-series of a few books I recommend reading if you want to do Startups (in Germany). **Todays segment will be about Rework and Delivering Happiness**.

### Rework

The best and one and only book talking about how to build and run a modern-day tech service company in the times of world wide internet. Written by [37Signals founder](http://37signals.com/) Jason Fried this book does not talk about theory but actual practice on run a non-startup. Aside from its great content, this books also trims down on text size and cuts down anything that isn't crucial. Less is more as one of the main principles he is talking about, every point he tries to make he delivers on less than two pages. No rambling around their experience and half their biography, just plain simple no bullshit cut to the chase approach.

This book ruined me and I get easily upset with books that waste my time going on for chapters about unimportant non-information now. And though it has been three years since this book got published I still quote and give it as a gift to friends frequently. If you have exactly one book you are allowed to read before starting your business, read this one.

### Delivering Happiness

Tony Hsieh, [CEO of Zappos.com](http://www.zappos.com/), wrote this excellent book. Though it reads itself like a story, the story of the struggles they went through, it is about much more than the just starting a business: with this book Tony claims that the two most important things for a company are and always should be the happiness of the employees and the customers - no matter what. He went through many sacrifices to make this happen, didn't sell out when he could have but was as loyal to his employees and customers as he could be. And they paid it back by being loyal in the same way. 

This books explains very well why this company unlike so many others was able to not only get over so many obstacles but also do things so many other business unable to do, like relocating to a totally different city and not losing your staff. More than a startup story this is a manifest for declaring your company your family and treat them like that as the ultimate way of being successful. Such an inspiring story, I wish more startup were build by these principles.

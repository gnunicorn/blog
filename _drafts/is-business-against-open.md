A few weeks ago I wrote about [the many ways Google is screwing the open (source) community](/2014/04/22/stop-it-open-source-google-aint-gonna-care-about-you-ever) all the time and it left me pondering. I've talked a lot about business models, the startup scene and technology disruptive ecosystem in this blog over the past years. I always liked the entrepreneurial attitude of getting things done instead of talking and lamenting about them for so long. But I cam to realise that especially if they are backed with investors money, also these startups become these soley profit oriented corporations they fought against in their beginning. And not only in a few cases turn against the open culture they originated from. Leaving me with the question: is business against open in general?

We have discussed this in [twitter getting more restrictive in their API terms](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/16/twitter-api-changes-2012_n_1793248.html) the more successful it became or the most recent [Makerbot filing patents on inventions of community origin](http://www.openbeamusa.com/blog/2014/5/22/stay-classy-makerbot). And that both makes sense – from a profit perspective. The more competition you have the less profit you'll make in a market. Therefore anything that cripples competition is in their interest. Including other community efforts for innovation and progress. I'm not saying all companies are against progress and innovation but ones has to see that at least for investors – and they buy themselves a lot of power on investing – it is about the money. And the second something in the market happens that threatens their share of it, they will make sure the company fights it.

The same goes almost without saying, for any kind of opening up their own data and data centers. The investors as well as the CEOs will only allow this to happen if it makes them money (or not doing so means a loss of money). And on every pitch deck you'll find the founders thoughts about how they will try to "lock in their customer" with almost always something else than "delivering a product/service that people love and are willing to pay for". Because if someone else could come, take the same data and offer a better service, you'd be out of business. But this fundamental idea is one of the driving concepts behind OpenSource: that anyone could come and make a better version of what you've been doing. Something Business wants to prevent whereever it can. At least when we talk about any bigger type of business case.

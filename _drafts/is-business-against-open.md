title: "Is business against open?"
tagline: "Is businesses generally set up against an open culture?"
description: "A few weeks ago I wrote about [the many ways Google is screwing the open (source) community](/2014/04/22/stop-it-open-source-google-aint-gonna-care-about-you-ever) all the time and it left me pondering. I've talked a lot about business models, the startup scene and the technology-driven disruptive ecosystem in this blog over the past years. I always liked the entrepreneurial attitude of getting things done instead of accepting the status quo. But I came to realise that especially if they are backed with investors money, also great startups turn into profit oriented corporations – exactly what they fought against in their early days. Not only in a few cases they also turn against the open culture they originated from. Leaving me with the question: is business – in general – against open?"

A few weeks ago I wrote about [the many ways Google is screwing the open (source) community](/2014/04/22/stop-it-open-source-google-aint-gonna-care-about-you-ever) all the time and it left me pondering. I've talked a lot about business models, the startup scene and the technology-driven disruptive ecosystem in this blog over the past years. I always liked the entrepreneurial attitude of getting things done instead of accepting the status quo. But I came to realise that especially if they are backed with investors money, also great startups turn into profit oriented corporations – exactly what they fought against in their early days. Not only in a few cases they also turn against the open culture they originated from. Leaving me with the question: is business – in general – against open?

We have discussed this when [twitter was getting more restrictive in their API terms](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/16/twitter-api-changes-2012_n_1793248.html) or the most recently [when Makerbot was filing for patents on inventions of community origin](http://www.openbeamusa.com/blog/2014/5/22/stay-classy-makerbot). Both cases make a hell lot of sense – from a profit and business perspective. The more competition you have the less profit you'll make in a market. Ergo, anything that cripples competition is in the companies interest. Including other community efforts for innovation and progress. I'm not saying all companies are against progress and innovation, but ones has to understand that at least for investors – and they buy themselves a lot of power when investing – it is primarely about the money. The instant something happening threating their market share, those investors will make sure the company fights it – that is called "protecting ones investment".

The same goes almost without saying, for any kind of opening up their own data and data centers. The data, the optimisation and extortion a business can make out of it, are business secrets. The investors as well as the CEOs will only allow this data to get out if it makes them money (or not doing so means a loss of money). **On each and every pitch deck you'll find the founders thoughts about how they will try to "lock in their customer"**. And it is never "delivering a product/service that people love and are willing to pay for". Because if someone else could come, take the same data and offer a better service, you'd be out of business. It is an imminent thread to any business and they will do everything in their power to prevent it.

And this is where the crux lies. Exactly this "forking", that anyone could come and make a better version of what you've been doing is a build into the fabric of OpenSource and a fundamental aspect of any truly open community. Rendering these both incompatible in their very core architecture. One considers innovation a thread to its existance the other praises it for its progress that it brings to society. So maybe just bringing "open" to business isn't gonna work. I think we have to rethink business in total to make it work with open at all.

I recently published my projectories for this year as being rather boring than interesting for the Berlin startup scene. Looking at these numbers it is pretty obvious, the startup hype in Berlin was just exactly that: a hype. But does that mean the hype is over? Yes. And no. On one side because investors, but also mass-media will continue to tell the tale of Soundcloud and the Wunderkinder. And though tech-wise, the scene will consolidate even further, Berlin has by far the best chances to become a startup center in all cities of Europe.

And that is exactly, why the hype will stay alive. Hypes end because another hype takes over. But there is no hype in sight. And with the continuous attention that entrepreneurship gains, where should it move? No, the Berlin Startup Hype is well and alive. And its only chance, too. By keeping the hype alive, you create the illusion that it is easier here than somewhere else, which attracts talent. And if you just attracted enough talent – goes the tale – you'll find the gem in the haystack (and a blind chicken). Meaning a hype, if just sustained long enough, becomes a self-fullfilling prophecy.

The question is just, what hype will it be? The numbers suggest, it will become highly attractive for MBA, Marketing and Sales people in the near future. But if Berlin itself continues its growth in the tech and software developers sector, this MBA-Trend might just be a short-time hickup.

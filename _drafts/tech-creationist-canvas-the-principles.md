Before you start building your own Tech Creationist Canvas, you should understand what basics, principles and ideas it is build upon. It helps you greatly to understand the questions asked and how the canvas will help and guide you in the aspect unclear about your tech venture.

You can also directly jump to the in-depth explanation of the specific sections or consult the guide about helping with the online editor.

# The Tech Creationist Canvas: the principles


## Iterative

The Tech Creationist Canvas is build on the iterative principles and ideas of the Lean Startup Canvas (LSC). It is a one-pager with multiple sections giving you an overview and insight of the most important aspects of the tech venture to model. Similar to the LSC it isn't meant as a static page but should be evaluated and iterated upon. Think of it as the framework around the agile development cycle, the big picture if you will. After every iteration of every cycle, you should go back to the canvas and rethink whether it still makes sense, what needs to be changed and what is the most important risks to evaluate next. This should be the focus of the next cycle then.

## Purpose driven

The Canvas is build with tech ventures at heart. It focuses not on a vage "added value" but instead on purpose knowing that most developer founded ventures are started and continued out of higher purpose than money or just added value. It therefore also forces the user to think about these aspect and who the benefactors of the technology build are. Through the purpose driven approach it narrows the development of technology towards a real world impact which should be taken into account from early on.

Through the assumption that developer funded tech ventures are build upon purposes (instead of money or "vage value") it allows for modelling of other kinds of organisations than just profit-oriented businesses including non-profits, single-developers and development groups as well as volunteer organisations. And it forces those to also think about their sustainability of the project they are creating.

## Aware of Structure

Through focussing on the a real world impact for actual people (rather than customers) the canvas leaves open how the technology is developed or build while narrowing towards the eventual benefactors the founders had in mind. This allows for a wide range of experimentation with technology and broadens the thinking above it in itself and asks the questions of delivery early on. Through that allowing to be modelled very early in the development process.

Aware that it will and should be used early on in a technology development project, the canvas acknowledges the inherintly different structure of the building process as it is so common in our industry. And asks both the question on how this will be build initially and how to make it a sustainable system. Through that reminding the funders that it is probably helpful to think of both areas and more over not get stuck in the "just this other features"-loop instead of going out and making an impact.

## Knowing the target group

By honestly approaching this problem heads on and through fueling the thoughts of the eventual benefactors early on, the Canvas aids the tech founder in thinking about who to talk to to make their venture sustainable. While most other canvases think in business terms here (with revenue and profit in their heart), the Tech Creationist Canvas acknowledges that many projects are funded through the founders people time (and might be able to sustain that way) or through third parties that aren't necessarily the primary benefators but have an interest in aiding in the process like NGO's, governments, accellerators or venture capitalists.

## Goals

Through all of these factors the Tech Creationist Canvas is a tool to support the developer(s) in gauging their risks and evaluate their ideas towards impact and sustainability from early on. It asks the the techies the tough questions and helps in finding solutions for those. Questions it is only able to answer through its in depth understanding of how technology is developed and the cycles are structured.

Overall the goal of the Tech Creationist Canvas is to aid the developer in thinking further than the initial build of some fun technology towards the real life impact, how to deploy that and how to make sure it can reach that through a sustainable funding model.

One of the first things I do when thinking about new projects or even existing companies and their business models, is I build a lean canvas about it. I am a big sucker for the lean canvas, it captures more on one page than most business plans in over thirty pages. That said, I am getting increasingly frustrated with it. The Lean Canvas, as an evolution of the Business Model Canvas, clearly comes from a business perspective and a certain profit-driven mindset. But when you talk about tech startups, anything community-driven or inherently open and social ventures, the Lean Canvas doesn't only fall short in describing, it is right to the point harmful. Similar to the saying "bad information is worse than no information at all", the Lean Canvas gives you false confidence by putting you and your idea into a certain structure, leading to specific thinking which is actually off path.

Just try to fit something like OpenTechSchool, Hackership, Discourse or – for the sake of argument – Mozilla into it. All of them have a higher purpose than profit creation. I'd go so far to argue that most developer started their venture of higher purpose – like fixing a specific problem they encounter a lot or see other people suffering from. If money was the argument, many wouldn't start at all as their rather liberal employment is for sure a better source of income. Aside from so many staying loved pet or side-projects for ever, especially in open source. So, sure, you can fill in the whole Canvas for Mozilla but it won't capture what Mozilla is about. It even drives you off path of what Mozilla is about by making you think about their customers (what now?), the channel to reach them (does this New Yorker Ad fall into that category?) and more over the "unfair advantage".

Mozilla doesn't want to have an unfair advantage. Though you could argue that through their brilliant developers they technically are in an position that is hard to match giving them an unfair advantage. But they do that at beyond the market salaries. If it was about money, you could easily match up to this. The thing is, that it isn't. Mozilla isn't about money. Mozilla is about openness, about progress and fixing the problems. That's why so many techies – including me – struggle with the Lean Canvas: it misses the point. We don't care about making money – that's a side-effect to keep paying rent. We take the step because we want to make a difference, want our work to benefit others having a similar itch and make a tiny, purposeful dent in the universe. So unless your venture concept development tool lets you express that, it will lead you off path. Like the Lean Canvas does for most tech ventures.

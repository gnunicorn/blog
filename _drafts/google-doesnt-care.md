Dear OpenSource,

we gotta talk. About your relationship with Google. Google screws you over and over but you keep coming back to it. Don't you understand Google only wants you for your developers, market share and code?  Google really doesn't care about you. It couldn't care less. It just takes and takes and then, whenever it reaches enough power, it drops you like a hot potato. Every time. But you come back to it for every  "Summer of code" and start believing that it cares. But it doesn't.

When and how, you ask? Well, okay, let's talk just about the most recent ways G decided to screw you over.

### XMPP

For example when it was deep in the mist of lacking market share on Instant Messengers and then announced its new system will <s>piggy-back</s> be based on the open, federated [XMPP protocol](http://xmpp.org/). Didn't it feel great when they contributed the famous Jingle Spec for live-audio/video-streaming? Totally understandable you fell for it and believe it. So pretty and nice. But you didn't only join it full-heartly, you even convinced everyone that they should use its product (GTalk) because it is an "open protocol". But then, when they had enough market share, [they just dropped you](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/google-abandons-open-standards-instant-messaging) – for no apparent reason. "Technical demands" my ass. It simply got what it wanted – market share – and now it doesn't need you anymore, Open Source. It never cared about an "open protocol".

Not yet convinced?

### Blink, there is a browser war

How about when Google realized that the next generation of power lies in the browser and noticed it doesn't have shit market share there? It build its own browser, called Chrome, based on the open Webkit-Framework (a fork of KDE's KHTML). It contributed a lot to that framework and to the market in general – but so did you. Until its browser had a significant market share making it more interesting to have full control over the whole setup than being open and compatible – and [so G announced Blink](http://www.cnet.com/news/google-parts-ways-with-apple-over-webkit-launches-blink/). With which G didn't only fork the project but started another browser war with Apple by [removing previously added features and making it incompatible](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/kTktlHPJn4Q/YrnfLxeMO7IJ) _on purpose_. The supposedly technical reasons – again very much in question. With that history and [G's push to have DRM as part of the HTML5-Specs](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/23/microsoft_google_netflix_html5_drm_infection/), you really want to tell me G cares about an "open web"? Bullsh*t!

### But there's Android!

"But.. But.. Android!" You say. Right. Let's talk about our favorite "Open Source"-Platform "Android". Yes, sure, the [Source-Code of the Operating System is under an Open License and can be downloaded](http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html). And so are its apps. But unlike other Linux, Android isn't an Operating System only, it comes with strings attached. Let's be clear the Smartphone Market is about the Apps and the overall Platform – the marketplace, the cloud-services and developer SDKs and services. With the stock apps not being maintained or updated, getting replaced with Google-infrastructure-tied Apps in their own version, more and more Developer-SDK Features being tied to the Google Cloud Services, the _open platform_ lacks a little more every day. It is a slow and subtle process. Meanwhile more and more Apps – also from third-party vendors – rely on Googles own Play-Services and infrastructure. [This way, overall Android is rendered "unforkable"](http://www.cnet.com/news/what-google-really-means-when-it-calls-android-open/). Even with big resources [like Nokia and Microsoft, you wouldn't be able to pull it off](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/02/neither-microsoft-nokia-nor-anyone-else-should-fork-android-its-unforkable/). As it is also secured with contracts and legal shenanigans everywhere – Android is everything but open. Sorry, honey, but your favorite Android is probably the biggest of all those "Openess"-lies G has ever told.

### Openwashing for the win

I am not writing this to make you made. After all Google is in it for the money. I am writing this because I care about you. You've been subjected to very well executed [Openwashing](http://readwrite.com/2011/02/03/how_to_spot_openwashing#awesm=~oBvV2XjKHHyDZl) by Google. But every time you get in bed with G, you get hurt and end up less powerful than before. G has just been using you all along, this is what I tried to point out here. Whenever G opens its mouth to tell you something, be sure it is lying.

I know it's hard to hear, but, **OpenSource, it is time to break up with Google**. Once and for all.

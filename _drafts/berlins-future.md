Looking back over the last two years onto Berlins finest startups, leaves you wonder, what the year 2014 will hold for the scene. Those two years have not been good. Though a few events shared more light from all over europe to the city and the hype that Berlin is the next Silicon Valley is still going strong, but the reality looks very different. It suggests that there will be more companies doing more boring things. And no end in sight.

At the beginning of 2013 looking back on the year before, revealed it has been the lowest in investments since 2006 in Berlin. Latest numbers suggest, 2013 went even lower. And while some have cashed in nicely, it was only in the sectors of follow-up financing in Series-B or later. Series-A – the first after the initial early stage fund, usually in the lower millions – especially around those startups, which lead us believe in a creative Berlin, were nowhere to find. Leading to only one possible outcome: closing them. 

Though the news around that, might still sounds good, the fact that Gidsy, Amen and Mooped were not able to create traction around their products, puts quite the dent into the creative techie startup scene. And runner ups? Well, the clear winners of last year were the big-fund-systems expanding e-commerce all over the world into other markets. Not really creative, nor even very techy. Investors became more cautious, e-commerce is always the safer bet – Boring but safe. Clearly visible when the local Fund-Manager of the most vocal Berlin-centered VC re-defines the term "disruptive" by "reapplying new markets".

Ladies and Gentlemen, on actual tech-matters, we shouldn't expect to much from this year. Last year was already low on new ideas or technologies getting funding, but even if there was interesting Early-Stage-Funding, this year will probably become even harder for unique ideas to get enough money to continue. The excitement on investors-side definetely didn't hold up and they've become more critical – in the classic German way: "What are you sales numbers? You don't have any? Well, then let's talk again once you do!". If you don't have good numbers, start raising even earlier, it's gonna be a tough year.

Over the last couple of weeks I've taken a deeper look into the Lean Startup Canvas. It is an great tools to gauge risks and evaluate business models and is widely used in tech. However, I came to the conclusion that for developer-driven tech ventures it isn't only a bad fit, it is outright harmful – read more about that here. Today I want to talk about an alternative approach.

# Introducing: The Tech Creationist Canvas.

Based on the iterative ideas and principles of the Lean Startup Canvas, the Tech Creationist Canvas also is a living document. Though totally applicable for startup and businesses in general, the Tech Creationist Canvas has the desired purpose at heart and asks the author to think about the problem, the solution, the benefactors (rather than customers) and how to reach them through that lense.

Build for tech ventures, the Tech Creationist Canvas is very well aware of the inherinetly different structure of their production cycle. Allowing it to forces the author to think about the initial costs as well as how, when and through whom to make it grow and sustain from early on. And through that avoid common pitfalls and the "just that other feature"-loop.

## Including an editor – free and open source

One common issue I, as a developer, have with many business tools is that they aren't very accessible nor easy to track or spread. A paper  with post-its simply isn't very helpful in a distributed team, most online tools don't even allow public sharing nor proper exporting.Annoyed by this lack of accessibility, I have developed a yaml-file based Editor and Renderer for the Tech Creationist Canvas, with plenty of example to get you started quickly.

By using a text-based file, you can track the source in your Git-Repository alongside the Readme and the Licence-File. The online editor has build-in support for loading canvases from github repositories, gists and through base64-data-parameters. Please don't hesitate to report bugs or send pull request on it.

## The experiment continues

Though I am quite happy with the state the Tech Creationist Canvas is at right now (I call it Version-1), I don't consider it a static tool either but a living experiment. Over the next couple of weeks I test the Tech Creationist Canvas by using it as a case-file manager, trying to describe existing (and upcoming) tech ventures in a series about OpenSource, Community-driven Businesses.

And I'd like to have your feedback and input, too: What do you think about the Canvas? Does it work for your case? Or are you feeling/knowing something important is missing if you model through that? Please let me know, through the comments here, Github Issues or an email directly (<ben [at] create-build-execute [dot] com>).

I already <span class="strikethrough">ranted</span>wrote about the [Lean Startup Canvas last week](/2014/07/22/lean-canvas-missing-pieces/). Thinking it further, I find there are many more things wrong with it when applied to developer-founded tech ventures. While missing the purpose is a big one, you could try to squash it into the unique value proposition somehow. But then still the Lean Canvas will fail most tech ventures on multiple other aspects.

### Product vs. Market

There has been plenty of talking about product vs. market approach. Not only few companies focussed on a specific problem to solve at the beginning and left the question of finding the market for way later – Twitter, Google and Facebook are just the most famous among them. And though I've been in favour of taking potential markets into account from early on, the **reality is** that there is little point doing that, **when you just started coding**: It is an **experimental stage**, there is nothing to see, test or prove for weeks or months into the project easily.

If there is one thing to learn from the principles of agile development, then  that things change so much during a software development process cycle, that the end-result barely resembles the original idea. For our case, this means **the likelihood of the end technology still being a great fit for the market decided on at the beginning is rather small**. Even worse, it creates an harmful narrowing of the focus: Deciding on how and to whom to sell a technology that hasn't even been developed yet, leads to focussing **on building something sellable rather than exploring the actual impact a technology could have**.

A great example showing these are the numerous tech ventures where the _customer_ isn't even the primary _user_ (just think about Twitter, Google or Facebook again). By narrowing your focus to build something you can sell, you can easily forget to make it attractive to the people actually using it – which aren't your customers per se. This doesn't only apply to ad-driven social networks, it is equally true for building a platform for fund-raising or petitions: if users aren't on your platform, no "customer" ever wants to talk about running a campaign on your platform in the first place. And by narrowing your focus only on the sellable aspects, you **easily oversee great opportunities of making an impact which you can't immediately monetize**.

Ergo, instead of thinking of the "market" when building up a tech projects, you should think about those, who'll ultimately benefit from the technology first, and make sure you tailor a product to them. Once there is a committed user base, it is much easier to think on how to make it run sustainable.


### Time vs. Money

Another aspect that strikes me as odd is then equal treatment of time and money. Considering that more than just a few of tech projects are passion projects, the time people spend on them without any financial gain whatsoever is immense. By putting a price tag on it, you don't only de-value the time spend, you will also rationally come to the conclusion that the project is too expensive. **If your calculate did include the time spend by the founding developer**, break even is barely possible and so far ahead that **the project should never have been started in the first place**. But as the founder isn't doing it for profits, that barely matters.

There are currently two main strategies to deal with that seemingly harmful aspect in the Lean Startup Canvas: you either start the canvas only after you've already build the MVP ignoring any time already put into it so far, or you leave it out all together. Both totally **devaluing the work done by the founding developer(s)**. And yet another thing you have to work around the Canvas to make it work for Tech – yay.


### Building vs. Sustaining

I always found it awkward to deal with the bottom-line part of the canvas. I'd always start by adding "initial build" as a cost, and than had to add the "hosting" running costs. Looking at it, it feels odd. Because most tech ventures require a big up-term _time_ commitment and if done right, can run on rather low _money_. By mixing upfront with running costs and time with money, the Lean Canvas makes the costs structure an unbalanced big blur. Which feels odd but I could live totally live with, if this wouldn't lead into the Lean Canvas skewing the entire picture for tech ventures.

To us developers, **building is a fun the part**. We developers love to build things, it is highly rewarding, challenging and easy to be passionate about. These intial time commitments aren't costs to us – they are benefits. But when it comes to marketing, selling and growing that experiment into an impacting technology it becomes costly to us. **As selling doesn't come naturally to techies, the costs of sustaining a project are perceived as much higher than building it**. Quite the opposite of how most MBA's see it (who generally struggle with creating a good product but have no trouble selling one). By ignoring this fundamental difference between initial building and sustaining a project, the Lean Canvas overlooks an important aspect of a tech ventures cycle.

And an important break point, too. Because **once the initial version works, techies should take a good look where it might already be applicable and begin selling it**, smoothly moving the project over to become sustainable. Though that isn't as hard, techies rather like to avoid the question at all by pretending it needed "just this other feature before it can be launched". And then the project lingers until it is abandoned all together¹. An important threat to tech ventures, and a missed opportunity to be address by the Lean Startup Canvas.


### It needs something else

The premise is simply different for tech ventures. A canvas for tech creation needs to take into account that marketing might not be the natural thing to people. That costs in time and money are inherently different and that profit simply isn't a primary motivation. Finally it needs to understand the fundamental difference between building the first version versus running an on-going projects. A good tech creation canvas has to assists developers in thinking about their benefactors and user base early, without narrowing the focus of the technology to what can be sold only.

If done early on, this in turns helps realise when is the right time to take the step of publishing and promoting. By having that stated black on white, I believe this can minimize the fear and motivate to go out and do the – for developers – hard part of selling it. So the technology can realise and live up to its potential impact. The Lean Canvas is not able to deliver on any of these accounts. We need something else².

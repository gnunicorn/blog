I already <span class="strikethrough">ranted</span>wrote about the [Lean Startup Canvas last week](/2014/07/22/lean-canvas-missing-pieces/). After giving it some more thought, I now realize that the problems with the canvas extend beyond its focus on profit as the main purpose for any venture. In fact, I argue that the canvas fails to capture the nature of many tech-driven ventures, as well as the motivation of the founders. Let me explain:

### Product vs. Market

There has been plenty of talk about a product vs. market approach. Should you find a market first, or focus on the product you want to build? As it turns out, many successful companies started by focussing on a specific problem to solve and left the question of finding the right market for way later – Twitter, Google and Facebook are just the most famous among them. Yet, the primary focus of the Startup Canvas is on the market. 

Even though I've been in favour of taking potential markets into account from early on, the **reality is** that there is little point in doing that **when you just started coding**: This is an **experimental stage**, there is nothing to see, test or prove for weeks or months after you start project.

If there is one thing to learn from the principles of agile development, it is that your product changes a lot during a software development process cycle. Consequently, the end-result often barely resembles the original idea. For our case, this means that **the likelihood of the end technology still being a great fit for the market you decided on at the beginning is rather small**. Even worse, overly focussing on a market creates a harmful narrowing of your focus: Deciding on how and to whom to sell a technology that hasn't even been developed yet, leads to focussing **on building something sellable rather than exploring the actual impact a technology could have**.

Another great example of why the market-first approach will often be the wrong one are the numerous tech ventures where the _customer_ isn't even the primary _user_ (just think about Twitter, Google or Facebook again). By narrowing your focus to build something you can sell, you can easily forget to make it attractive to the people actually using it – which aren't your customers per se. This doesn't only apply to ad-driven social networks, it is equally true for building a platform for fund-raising or petitions: if users aren't on your platform, no "customer" ever wants to talk about running a campaign on your platform in the first place. And by narrowing your focus only on the sellable aspects, you **easily overlook great opportunities for making an impact that you can't immediately monetize**.

Ergo, instead of thinking of the "market" when building a tech project, you should think about those who'll ultimately benefit from the technology first, and make sure you tailor a product to them. Once there is a committed user base, it is much easier to think about how to make it run sustainable.


### Time vs. Money

Another aspect that strikes me as odd is the canvas' equal treatment of time and money, when calculating costs. Considering that more than just a few tech projects are passion projects, the time people spend on them without any financial gain whatsoever is immense. By putting a price tag on that, you don't only devalue the time spend, you could also come to the conclusion that the project is simply too expensive. In fact, for many projects it is true that **if your calculation includes the time spend by the founding developer**, break even is barely possible. Or at best, the break even point is so far ahead that **the project should never have been started in the first place**. But, if the founder isn't doing it for profits, that hardly matters.

There are currently two main strategies to deal with this harmful aspect in the Lean Startup Canvas: you either start the canvas only after you've already build the MVP, ignoring any time already put into it, or you leave it out all together. ??? Both totally **devalue the work done by the founding developer(s)**. 

So there you go, we found yet another thing you have to work around to make the Canvas work for Tech – yay.

NOTE: DEVALUES THE TIME SPEND IS A BIT VAGUE. 

### Building vs. Sustaining

I always found it awkward to deal with the bottom-line part of the canvas. I'd always start by adding "initial build" as a cost, and than had to add the "hosting" running costs. Looking at it, it feels odd. Because most tech ventures require a big up-term _time_ commitment and if done right, can run on rather low _money_. By mixing upfront with running costs and time with money, the Lean Canvas makes the costs structure an unbalanced, big blur. 

Why is this such a big deal?

To us developers, **building is a big part of the fun**. We developers love to build things, it is highly rewarding, challenging and easy to be passionate about. These intial time commitments aren't costs to us – they are benefits. But when it comes to marketing, selling and growing that experiment into an impacting technology it becomes costly to us. **As selling doesn't come naturally to techies, the costs of sustaining a project are perceived as much higher than building it**. Quite the opposite of how most MBA's see it (who generally struggle with creating a good product but have no trouble selling one). By ignoring this fundamental difference between initial building and sustaining a project, the Lean Canvas overlooks an important aspect of a tech ventures cycle.

And, an important break point too. Because **once the initial version works, techies should start considering where it might already be applicable and begin selling it**, smoothly moving the project into a sustainable venture. Though that isn't necessarily a hard thing to do, techies often prefer to avoid the question altogether, while keeping their focus on the product. "I just need one more feature before it can be launched". And then the project lingers, until it is ultimately abandoned¹. This is an important threat to tech ventures, and a missed opportunity to be address by the Lean Startup Canvas.

NOTE: MAKE SURE IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS SECTION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE TIME VS MONEY ONE. THEY NOW FEEL LIKE YOU ARE REPEATING YOURSELF A BIT.

### It needs something else

The premise is simply different for tech ventures. A canvas for tech creation needs to take into account that marketing might not be the natural thing to people. That costs in time and money are inherently different and that profit simply isn't a primary motivation. Finally it needs to understand the fundamental difference between building the first version versus running an on-going projects. A good tech creation canvas has to assists developers in thinking about their benefactors and user base early, without narrowing the focus of the technology to what can be sold only.

If done early on, this in turns helps realise when is the right time to take the step of publishing and promoting. By having that stated black on white, I believe this can minimize the fear and motivate to go out and do the – for developers – hard part of selling it. So the technology can realise and live up to its potential impact. The Lean Canvas is not able to deliver on any of these accounts. We need something else².

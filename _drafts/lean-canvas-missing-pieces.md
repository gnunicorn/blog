I already <span class="strokethrough">ranted</span> wrote about the [Lean Startup Canvas last week](/2014/07/22/lean-canvas-missing-pieces/). Thinking about it further, there are actually a lot of things the Lean Startup Canvas does wrong for development-founded tech ventures. Sure, missing the purpose is a big one, but even if you could somehow squash that into the unique value proposition, the Lean Canvas will still fail most tech ventures.

### Product vs. Market

There has been plenty of talking about product vs. market approach. Not only few startups started up with a problem they wanted to solve and the question of finding the market hasn't been solved for much later – Twitter, Google and Facebook are just the most famous among them. And though I've been in favour of taking potential markets into account from early on, the reality is that there is little point doing that, when you start coding at the beginning: There is nothing to see, test or prove for weeks or months into the project. When there is one main point Agile development is about, it is about making you accept that things change during that process so much, that the end-result barely resembles the original intention. Meaning the likelihood of the technology coming out is still fitting the initial market is rather slim.

Even worse, discussing how and to whom to sell a technology that isn't even developed yet too early on, leads the venture into narrowing their focus on the wrong side resulting in the technology not having the freedom it needs to reach its actual potential. A great example showing these are the numerous tech ventures where the _customer_ isn't even the primary _user_ (just think about Twitter, Google or Facebook again). By focussing on the customer, you very easily miss the point of making it usable for those actually using it. This doesn't only apply to ad-driven social networks, it is equally true for building a platform for fund-raising or petitions: if users aren't on your platform, no "customer" ever wants to talk about running a campaign on your platform in the first place. Ergo, instead of thinking of the "market" when building up a tech projects, you should think about those, who'll ultimately benefit from it, and make sure you tailor a product for them. Once there is a committed user base, it is much easier to think on how to make it run sustainable. Tech is just a little different on that.


### Time vs. Money

Another aspect that strikes me as odd is equal treatment of time and money. Let's be honest, more than just a few of tech projects are passion projects. The time people spend on them before is immense. By putting a price tag on it, you don't only de-value the time spend you will also – rationally – come to the conclusion that the project is too expensive. If you'd include the time spend by the founding developer into your calculations, break even is barely possible. But that doesn't really matter either, because that founder is not doing it for any profits. There are currently two main strategies to deal with that negative calculation in the Lean Startup Canvas: you either start the canvas only after you've already build the MVP so you can ignore any time already put into it, or you leave it out all together. Both totally devaluing the work done by the founding developer(s). And yet another aspect to leave out of the Canvas to make it work for Tech – yay.


### Building vs. Sustaining

Whenever I was looking at the bottom-line part of the Canvas, I had to add "initial build" as a cost, because the canvas doesn't separate between one-time and the fix-costs to run it on a daily basis. By forcing you to think in money instead of time-terms, you'd easily realise your project costs more to build the initial version (1 developer, full time for three months) than it will to run over the next three years. Especially if it was done with a real hacker mind-set that leverages distribution to keep running costs low. The costs section for tech ventures is always highly unbalanced, the "initial version" easily being ten times the expense of the next following entry "cloud hosting" needed for running it.

A little unbalance, I could live with, but in the Lean Canvas it skews the whole picture for tech ventures. Because building is a fun the part. Us developer love to build things, it is highly rewarding, challenging and easy to be passionate about. Those aren't costs to us. Only when it comes to marketing, selling and growing that initial version it becomes costly to us. Because those aren't things that come naturally to techies, the costs of sustaining a project are perceived as much higher than building it – the total opposite of how most MBA's see it. At the point of the initial version being done, techies most of the time should just take a close look whether it might already be market ready for some and try to get them on-board. Though that isn't as hard, techies rather like to avoid the question at all by pretending (and building) "just this other feature before it can be launched". And then the project lingers until it is abandoned all together¹.

The premise is simply different for tech ventures. A canvas for tech creation needs to take into account that marketing might not be the natural thing to people. That costs in time and money are inherently different and that profit simply isn't a primary motivation. Finally it needs to understand the fundamental difference between building the first version versus running an on-going projects. A good tech creation canvas has to assists developers in thinking about their benefactors and user base early, which in turns helps realise when is the right time to take the step for publishing the build. Through that it needs to motivate them to go out and do the – for them – hard part of selling it. So the project's potential impact can be realised. Unfortunately, the Lean Startup Canvas fails on all of these accounts. We simply need something else².

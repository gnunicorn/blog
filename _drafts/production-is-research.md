In the old classic style of working, you had one department doing research, one department doing development, one doing marketing and selling. Something that conceptionally didn't work with the agile software development and now spreads through agile management and development techniques. And raise the question: can agile be a more interesting alternative to the given research model? And if so, is our society equipped for this?



the old business model of doing research and then development is gone

- more and more research actually happens in the development of product, on the go
- boundries of technology are pushed for the user
- and it is faster, the market adoption rate is higher and it is more fun (because it doesn't take years before)
- with agile methods getting applied in more and more business fields, often called lean management and development, we have to ask ourselfs is the way our society structured working for this?

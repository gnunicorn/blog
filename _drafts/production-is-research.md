In the old classic style of working, you had one department doing research, one department doing development, one doing marketing and another selling your product. Something that conceptionally didn't work with the agile software development and now spreads through agile management and development techniques. And raise the question: can agile be a more interesting alternative to the given research model? And if so, is our society equipped for this?

In agile development with every cycle, you don't only reevaluate the feature you've been doing but the product and the goal in a whole. With lean startup this becomes even more customer and data driven. For a good reason, it also called the "scientific way of starting a business". These cycles require a constant rethinking and evalution of what one is doing and every one, who starts it is totally aware they'll end up somewhere totally else then they are currently thinking. And they need to get comfortable with that.

And though over the last decades also artist driven companies like Disney and later Pixar evangelist the approach of expriment-and-fail in fast cycles a lot by being very vocal about it and showed with their extraordinary results, how great this approach is, the majority of the population still thinks in these categories of research, development, production and deployment. And though this cycle didn't change, it just got much faster and its borders got blurry, it is a different approach and doesn't fit into classic systems, especially in publicly funded areas. Not only because you'd never get the contract if you'd honestly say you won't know what it the street will look like at the end, but also because they won't "fund research" and but those ministries, which do, don't want to give grants for "developing it for the market".

According to ministries, I can apply to do basic research but as soon as it involves talking to end customers, they aren't interested anymore. They believe this isn't scientific. But this system cripples itself, because those, who know how to apply for a grant for research, don't know how to deploy it to market. Even worth if you think of projects for the public, like if you do research to figure out a better way of city structure, this is all you get paid to do. Then there is another department, who might be looking into, how to practically apply this, if you are lucky. But to much research is still funded without the partical use case in mind and without trying to actually apply this. 

Just think if doctors would have done research this way, stopped once they had proven in a scientific paper that it could be solved but never developed they results into actual medication? We need to change our funding policies to be able to fund agile projects, to get real value to real people. 





the old business model of doing research and then development is gone

- more and more research actually happens in the development of product, on the go
- boundries of technology are pushed for the user
- and it is faster, the market adoption rate is higher and it is more fun (because it doesn't take years before)
- with agile methods getting applied in more and more business fields, often called lean management and development, we have to ask ourselfs is the way our society structured working for this?

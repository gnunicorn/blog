When I decided to refocus my writing to tech creationism around christmas 2012, it came out of the idea to simply collect all these ideas and insights I shared with founders and entrepreneurs in Berlin so often. Though they'd ask me to become their tech-cofounder, I mostly discussed business and product opportunities and the market psychology behind those with them. And I was just tired of repeating myself, so I decided to write those things down and share the public link with them, when I come accross that again.

The main reason for me to look at it that way, was that I had to do proper assements and due dilligence before going for it anyway and that way I was sharing my results with them and the world. And though this was the main incentive when I started this angle, I am actually not sure it ever caught on. Which is also due to the fact that I retracted myself more and more from the Berlin startup scene itself as it became, how I feel, even more detachted from earth and dilluted about itself and its business during the last year. The lack of proper technologies used, invented or needed and genuine ideas to be persued did its own part on this.

What I witnessed again, though, was that real great ideas, technologies and concepts build by hard-core techies, which sadly, did not caught on. I've always been good at seeing the potential of an applied technology immediatly. I think many techies, especially great hackers, can do that, too. Which very often is the initial reason they build what they are building. But then what I see happening a lot is that these fail short in getting adapted and gaining traction because coders, hackers never learned how to make them into a product. Once it is technically solved and has been tweeted, many are out of their home terretory, don't know what else to do and eventually drop it because it becomes to hard.

I've been there. Many times. I have many failed projects, great technology that I stopped developing because it didn't magically gain traction by itself but I also didn't know how to make it happen. And of course because I felt it wasn't yet, what it needs to be (EF YOU, perfectionism!). I cried about this in "next time someone other than me" but then came to the conclusion, that it really isn't too hard. And I've seen too many good ideas die just because the founders (coders!) weren't able to make it into a "sellable" product. So, about one year into tech creationism, I've decided to refocus towards helping exactly there: tech people with a technology who need help making that into a real product so it can have the impact it is supposed to have.

I am not a marketing person. Nor did I study business administration or management. But if you are a good hacker, you are smart enough to understand the underlying concepts and apply them. And it is all out there at the internets. But I'm not reading these business and marketing blogs either. Most of them are a pure waste of time. Honestly, it isn't rocket science. Most rules of business are hundreds of years old, which means people with the education level of a sales man during midival times were able to do them. Are you telling me you aren't less educated than a trader from 16th century?


Though that was the main incentive starting to write from the perspective I am writing, I am not sure it has actually cought up. 

 I was able to see by looking at it from a more big-picture-view and more systematic approaches.

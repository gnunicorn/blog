is there a regression in the net impact of a technology after its adaption?

- looking at cars a hundred years ago. The first thirty or fourty years the impact this technology had was tremendous, especially on a year-by-year basis for every place it reached
- but for the last thirty to fourty years it has basically stagnated and that is interesting because the cars are 10x more fuel efficient while being four too six times as powerful. Still we don't actually do much more with a car we do today as we did fourty years ago.
- this progress in technology almost all went into making cars more comfortable for the driver and the passengers but not even the net-space in the car of a similar category changed as much as the outer size of them would make you calculate. My parents were going to croatia with their car full of stuff in the early sixties. And though I have a car today six times as powerful and 25% bigger, it is still quite packed with stuff to go there and I am not there significantly faster, am more mobile or then they have been. Sure, it is more reliable, but still this is a questions of percentages not in magnitude: the net impact didn't change much more and compared to the impact it had at the beginning, it didn't do any significant progress. It was always sacrificed to put other, more technology in it.

But what if every technology is in the end destined to go that way. Through mass production and adaption by the masses, magnitudes of change become impossible but also through technology itself. Like looking at the batteries in phones and later smartphones. The technology made a leap in battery life while becoming smaller over the last 15 years of an incredible magnitude. Still a smartphone of today barely holds longer than a day in stand-by. Compare that with a Nokia from twelve years ago: All this progress has been eaten up by putting more technology in it. Now, you can argue that the impact that smartphones have are still in magnitudes compared to a decade ago. And while that is still true, what if it is decreasing? And in a decade from now the magnitude in technology progress does not anymore result in a magnitude impact. And if that is true, when and where is that tipping point? Or did we surpass it already?

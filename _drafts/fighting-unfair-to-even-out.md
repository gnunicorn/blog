I am a man of principle. And I am very proud of it. But from time to time one has to rethink ones principles, rules an behaviors. Because the world changes and so do we as people. And what we might considered a great principle at some point, turned out to be stupid or was circumstantial to an extend we didn't understand at the time. But when you stick to principles and rules solely based on the past this is called tradition and though might feel nice because it is familiar, might not be appropriate at the time any longer.

So. Moped got acquired. So another successful exit by a Berlin-based startup then? Awesome. I don't think so. Let me give you a few hints what this actually means and says. Hidden in plain sight. A case study of what to read when you hear a startup got acquired.

*Disclaimer: though I know some of the people involved in this deal personally and even had business relationships with some companies, I do not have nor expose any insider knowledge here (nor do I have any). This whole interpretation comes from the publicly available information published by said parties as well as common knowledge of existing systems.*

So, the first thing that comes to mind, is that this might be an acqui-hire, that one company just bought a bunch of engineers. But that is clearly not the case as not only the official blog posts of moped states this but also Wunderkinder acknowledged that in their blog post. The reason why this is said so clearly stays unknown, but it is to expect that the founders didn't actually like the deal nor did the teams work with each other. Then what is this deal about?

The second guess would be: Money! Fair guess. As no numbers where exposed in the intial press release, one could expect the founders to get their share of money from it. Until the Wunderkinder released in the same statement saying they aren't working with the new team, that they bought the software for "one month free usage of Wunderlist Pro". Ouch. That is worth than saying anything at all. You are paying them something everyone gets as a trial period anyways. For two years of work on a technology? That doesn't sound like any good deal at all. Though, to be fair, that "live technology" is available as OpenSource for free anyways. Raising the question, what technology they actually bought there (if they didn't buy any expertise/experts). Or, short: What the hell is going on?

Well, let's take one step back from the details of the deal and look at the bigger picture. The last funding round for Moped was lead by EarlyBird. Looking at the supposed amount raised and the size of the team, it is safe to assume Moped was about to run out of money soon unless they get another round of funding. For whatever reason that didn't really happen. The buying company, Wunderkinder, on the other side, also part of the EarlyBird portfolio, recently got a nice follow-up round from exactly that VC. Which in the view of the shortly after announced much bigger round, seems a little odd. To say the least. 

Or does it? If you are fimilar with venture capital, you know that the statistics are what matters most when it comes to raising the round after. And every failed startup in your former portfolio is one too many. So what do you do in case one of your companies is going to fail? Well, you make a deal with another portfolio company to buy that company. That way it was a "successful exit" instead of a failure. And everyone wins. 

Why I believe this is the most likely scenario of what happened? Well, usually, when you buy something you are excited about it. You are grateful to the founders and happy about their great work. While in this case the buying company made sure to discredet their newest (and first by the way) acquisition and distance themselfes from the founders and the original company as much as possible. That doesn't sound like someone, who wanted to buy in the first place. And looking at the result, they also didn't actually buy anything, neither did they pay for anything.

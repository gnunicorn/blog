NSA is an example case of big data.

And though what they take out of the data and the magnitude of the impact it has for life and democracy is truly threatening, it also shows what is possible with data today, that we can crawl huge amounts of data, looking and finding hidden treaasures.

Which is also the promise of the quantity self movement; to create a data basis of human life information, bigger than any research study could ever collect. But this also raises the question: how to ensure fair- and openness of that data. Is it really just or fair if the data, collected by millions of people for them (their "customers") soley accessible for that company? Companies by definition have an agenda and so what if the data shows is against that agenda? I think it is obvious, and the cases Facebook, Twitter and also Google have show that, this data needs to be public and accessible. But how? How could one publish this kinda of so extremely personal information but still respecting the privacy of people? Opt-in? Anonymisation? 

The problem with letting the user explicitly say they want to share their information and not do it otherwise, like Firefox, LibreOffice or many Linux Distributions do it, is that you'll always reach just a certain demographic of the people. And exactly that demographic, which already believes in that type of thing. This isn't only bad because it limits the amount of data you have in the end, it is also not a real representation so the conclusion you can draw from it are always within boundaries, too. And as such making this data useless for real research studies. 

So, collecting all data but anonymising it, then. Well the problem with anonymising lies in two parts. On one side a lot of data only makes sense if know a certain context around it, too. If you could and would successfully make any web-request anonymised from any other, it would be imopossible to understand how a user navigates through a website. And this is just a very simple example. If you want to tackle much bigger problems, you won't be able to do that without a certain amount of context information, collecting and profiling.
The other things lies in the question is it even possible to anonymise to such an extent? The recent case of the algorithm that made it possible to identify people within TOR, a proxy network which sole purpose is to anonymise web-traffic, raised that question again. And considering that the data isn't only collected for a long time but also available to the public, for everyone to read for decades to come, we have to estimate that any method we've been using today to anonymise privacy data will be broken at some point and compromised through future progress in technology.

It will always be impossible to have a big collection of data accessible to all and without any privacy concerns. But does that mean we should keep it hidden and have corporations with their agenda decide on what we have access to and what not? I don't think so. I think we have rethink allowing corporations to make the money out of the data while and society doesn't have any access to it. It is simply to much power in their hands. And this is a discussion that needs to happen now.

Example:

- internet becomes more mobile
 - email isn't only read at the desk anymore
 - email with important information is important when the thing happens, while the thing happens
- it will get worse with instant notification and more and more apps pushing news to the user all the time
 - it is up to the user to decide about these things and first started offering solutions, like google+ hangouts snoozing of notifications for a predefined period of time. To get back focus on what is important NOW.

When in the aftermath of the [Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed) bug [Steve Marquess's shared his insights on the funding behind the OpenSSL Library](http://veridicalsystems.com/blog/of-money-responsibility-and-pride/) that so many of us depend on, I was simply shocked and puzzled how they even got it that far with that little support. But it also showed an open wound we do have in our community: though the backbone of many services society depends on today, open source is chronically underfunded. Creating software takes time and focus, for which people need to get paid. Without business support, let's be frank, OpenSource wouldn't exist at all.

But OpenSource shouldn't be under mercy of businesss. Not only a few projects depend on the mercy of some tech supervisor at a random company with ignorant investors in their back. Which – as I pointed out previously – more often than not don't have an open agenda on their mind in the first place. Rendering many projects in highly critical situation of constant fear of ending upruptly. Which is a dependcy on business I don't think will sustain for much longer. Especially since more and more people seem to take OpenSource for granted and even with their business becoming rather big don't think about contributing back but are sure they build it all themselves. True support for OpenSource can only come from businesses which have OpenSource not only at their heart but part of their culture, identity and fabric of their core.

But what does that look like? We've seen the agency model grow and fail, similar goes to the consultancy model. Both sharing the problem of not really wanting good documenation, easy to setup system or outside coders at those mean less business for them. Then there is [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) and the LibreOffice Foundation – which I adore, don't get me wrong – which overall seems to live more the life of a non-profit charity and at its way being on the mercy of big-corp through donations, too. Quite obviously not something you can start and grow into easily either (both are actually the outcome of open sourcing previously huge corporate projects).

The more excited I am to follow how other models are doing. Like [redhat](https://www.redhat.com/), which uses the profits made with their Cloud-Services for enterprise to contiously develope further the LinuxKernel or the upcoming [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) also using their profits from hosting their software to pay developers to bring it further. Both are directly company/client facing businesses and that same model wouldn't really work for infrastructure open source solutions. So both [unhosted](https://unhosted.org/) and [hoodie](http://hood.ie/) are going a different way, use sponsorships to fuel initial development. Essentially [selling their presence and hotness amongst developer in small chunks to companies, who want to reach those](http://hood.ie/sponsoring). A highly interesting model and I am curious to see where this will be going.

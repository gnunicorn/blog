Writing about the moral distress of non-profit against for-profit companies, I realised another topic the TED talk touched and that I didn't quite realise until writing that post: the terminology. In the talk XXXXXX talks about the history of non-profit and show what it came from. Which also explains this rather weird term and its definition: wealthy business people were also running philanthropic endeavors to make their churches happy and feel morally okay doing big business. Unlike their actual business those rather small side-thingies were not for profit - hence the term. 

Totally understandable term, but what we mean by that changed since then. We fund companies and projects on the ground to never yield any profit now, we have plenty of organisations without any link to profit oriented business what so ever, either being paid through government, foundations or donations from the public. This is why this term always struck me as odd but I never questioned it. But now I do and I think it is time, we stop using it. And replace it with the terminology "for-good" entirely -- or at least for many cases. And this is why:


## Why link it to profit in the first place?

We have evolved as society since the days of pure industrial capitalism. There are more colors than profit or not. So many more shade and colors, but by using non-profit we fall back to a binary model of explaining the world. And use it as the starting value proposition. Is this really what we want to focus on in the non-profit field? Didn't you actually start the endeavor for a different reason, especially if profit isn't what you care about? I think you most likely have a more important first things to say.


## Negative taste

By using the negative term of something you define yourself but what the other is and saying, "that's what we are not". But you also use the negative, meaning everything the other side emphasis as very positive on your side by definition is not the case on your side. And for-profit for a while already talk about how great capitalism makes everything, how efficient it makes companies and effective it is. And all this is transported as "we are not" by saying you are a non-profit. Even if you are running things efficient, effective and good, the first thing you say is the opposite. 

## More shades of gray

As mentioned before, there are more than the binary black and white. This is why there are terms like social enterprise, social entrepreneurship and social franchise now. And the whole profit vs non-profit doesn't matter to them. Some might actually even yield a profit but that doesn't make them any less social. And others might yield non but or otherwise structure like a modern day company. And what about collectives? Or employee owned companies? Or a Kindergarden yielding a profit, which it gives to a charity? For-profit or not is merely a legal, structural question today. Not a categorization and most definitely not the distinction.


## Never use negative terms

The way our brain works doesn't allow us to think about negative things. You can't ["not think of a polar bear"] -- try it. If we hear non-X, the first thing we think of is the X, then we try to imagine the none, which we fail at terribly. This is why we one should always use positive language, it is a common communication tool to make clear language and is easier to understand. For the same reason it is much easier to understand what something is than what something is not, it makes it also much easier to image where things are going. For that simple reason you should always be "for" something rather than "against" something else.*

That's why I'm proposing the use of for-good, when appropriate and discard the usage of the term non-profit unless used to describe the legal company structure.


* A great example of this is actually Attac: the Anti-Globalisation movement was against international capitalism from its founding but when it failed human kind terribly in 2008/2009 and everyone turned to them to think about what to do instead, they didn't have any proposal and lost all its credibility. Their number one chance to take down the negative effects of globalisation and they blew it because by being so against it, they weren't _for_ anything.

## The Early Years
From early on I was interested in technology and engineering. Heck, when I got asked in kindergarten what I want to be some day, I said "inventor". A rather strange thought, is the common picture of an inventor in Germany that of the an Einstein-looking, crazy professor with long grey hair and a full beard in a white lab coat. But my next sentence was "because in order to be able to create something new you first have to know everything and understand how everything works. Otherwise how could you be sure it is new, right?". 

But for me technology has never been an end in itself. I do enjoy hacking through a weekend or twice but I understand technology as a servant to people. <abbr title="My childhood dream actually was to make so many machines that one day, people wouldn't have to work anymore - I really did not enjoy labour back then.">We build machines to make our life easier</abbr> and more pleasant. And if the technology does not do that what is its point?

But when I got into programming, with around twelve years of age, more and more systems, like vending machines for trains for e.G., were installed that were way to complex. Something I found really disturbing; because it is not the human in front who is to stupid to use, it is the technology which is not designed in a way that is accessible for them.

So one of the first bigger tech projects I did, while I was a teenager, was a concept of a completely new InternetCaf√© Kiosk software. And I did this from the point of a customer, I sketched out the whole thing, the whole UI and where the user had to click to do what. Though I never actually realised this project I learnt about myself that I am not really interested in making the backend behind how that works but making a pleasant product for users.

Being interested in movies and tv series I realised pretty quickly that multimedia software is a field that is still (up to this day) unsolved accessibility-wise <abbr title="in my honest opinion">imho</abbr> and worked VDR (a television recording software) and later Elisa (now [Moovida](http://www.moovida.com/)) a full blown media centre. Both Project are OpenSource, a culture I am naturally drawn to with my urge to want to understand every technology inside out. 

## Heading South

After my civil service I moved to Barcelona, Spain, to work for [Fluendo](http://www.fluendo.com/) - the company behind Elisa - full time. As the fourth employee I witnessed the rise and fall of the company and its product over the next two years first hand and learnt a lot about startups, teams, culture and products along the way. Aside from having the best software development mentor I could ever imagine at my side and learning from the best people in the field - the team behind the <a href="http://gstreamer.com/" title="The OpenSource Multimedia Framework based on a gobject using an asynchronous pipelining technology. E.g. Android is running on it - google it">GStreamer Project</a>.

But there I also learnt that technology isn't everything. At least if you do want to sell your products to real people and not just big corp. It also requires applied cases and real product with a benefit to the user. We in engineering have the tendency to over generalize our problems and with that our solutions. And while this means you can solve a lot of problems with it, you often lose focus. For e.g. we've build a fully extendible (a <abbr title="the highly extendable UI-Framework used in Firefox">XUL</abbr>-like UI-Plugin-system using a model-view-controller-concept with messaging in like <abbr title="the programming language Mac and iOS are build with">Objective-C</abbr>) of amazing capabilities but only had one external plugin developed with it ever (for a porn-website...).

Even worth when the technology is so far away from the people that it becomes too abstract in the way they can't see what it could be used for. And when they asked the engineer, what you can do it with it, receive the answer "everything, actually.". The most horrible answer you could ever give to people. I instead was always looking for ways on how to apply technologies to create some real value for people. 

And I also learnt that you have to keep a close eye on the market you are targeting. We were building a beautiful software for end-users while cable providers are giving away these boxes for free. And that is what the customer is used to be getting, a crappy UI but a free box. And only very few are and were interested in paying for a better UI, so unless you have a cable provider paying for your development - which he hadn't - no one is paying for it. Which also means no one ever used it.


## Berlin
So when moving to Berlin, I was hired by a startup to do software development but got more and more into product development and project management. I also got very involved in the upcoming startup scene and improved my eye on product creation not only by observing and analysing what was going on very closely but also by giving advice and feedback to founders about their products and technologies and helped quite a few getting their things straight.

As such I am now very connected in the Berlin Tech Startup Scene and internationally and mentor regularly at [StartupLive Weekends](http://startuplive.net), on the product and technology site of things. I recently cofounded the [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org) initiative as well, a group of hands-on developers and tech-savy people here from Berlin organising and hosting coding- and tech-workshops.

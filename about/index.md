<h4 class="text-info">My name is Benjamin Kampmann. I am a self-tought software engineer and product creator. I consult and advice tech companies and entrepreneurs on product creation and -development.</h4>

Before coming to Berlin to work as the tech product manager for a small startup for three years, I worked at a multimedia startup in Barcelona, Spain.

As a software engineer you learn to see pattern and find the small problem in the big systems - very quickly. I apply these same methods and principles to markets and products to figure out how to apply existing or upcoming technology to make a product with a benefit for customers. Exposed to the local startup scene over the last few years, I do not only have a big network this field (locally and internationally) but also have a wide understanding on how to get the things done most efficiently and actually ship stuff.

### What is Product Creation?

<h4 class="text-success"><strong>Product creation</strong> is the process of learning how to apply a technology to make it accessible, give value to a certain audience and bring it to life.</h4>

While product development is only about building a product and product management means optimising existing products, when I am talking about product creation I think of *seeing a need in a market*, think about existing and upcoming technologies and how you could apply them to fix that problem for the customers. Or the other way around, having a great technology at your hand and find a *real life appliance* for it, *build the product* around it and market is.

And such a path is usually full of uncertainties and short cuts you might have to take. It most definitely is not a straight way and therefore the only viable method to do real product creation is the [lean approach](http://theleanstartup.com/).

### For hire

<h4 class="text-error">If you need my help or support on your product, company or startup, just <a href="mailto: me at create-buid-execute dot com">email me</a> and we sit down and talk: the first round of feedback off the top of my head is free - as long as you pay for lunch or dinner.</h4>

For anything beyond that I am available for all kinds of arrangements: depending on whether you need a profound and in-depth market and product analysis as a one time consultancy contract, a product development workshop for your team or want me consult, advice or mentor you, your company or anyone within ongoing or regularly, I can think of different kinds of compensation and not all of them involve money. Just be creative. That is what entrepreneurs do after all: they solve problems in a creative way.
